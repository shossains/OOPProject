### Personal Development Plan

The most relevant strong    I have is that I am very driven to reach my goal.<br/>
If I try to achieve something with coding I will do everything it takes to make it work.<br/>
This of course can be troublesome because there might be a simpler solution to it.<br/>
I wouldn't call myself a perfectionist, not at all. I just want to achieve.<br/>

I have worked on (small) computer science projects in high school (mostly HTML, PHP and SQL).<br/>
In these projects I often took charge, because I was the most experienced in coding.<br/>
It is only after I started CSE that I realized that my knowledge of coding and computer science is just the bare minimum of what there is out there to learn.<br/>
Having worked in project before makes me experienced in group project.<br/>
I even have worked with Scrum before, which was quite a success.<br/>

My biggest pitfall might be that I tend to take too much *hooi op m'n vork*.<br/>
What might just look like simple challenges tend to turn out into the impossible quite often.<br/>
Only after (too) many tries I eventually give up and try to look for an alternative solution.<br/>

**G**<br/>
* Teamwork
Working in a team is something I have done quite often, but it never went smoothly.<br/>
Biggest bottleneck was communication.<br/>
Exchanging while after done editing, and sending uploaden duplicate files to server.<br/>
Now whe are using Git(lab) I hope problem won't occur.<br/>

* Dev-Client experience
I think this part is very useful for my possible future jobs and projects I will attend to.</br>
The interaction and communication between the client and the developer is a crucial part of the project which I would love to get more experience on.</br>

**R**<br/>
Well since we just started on this project, no progress has really occured.</br>
Thus no real statement can be made here.</br>

**O**<br/>
Working hard is the only option right here.</br>
Good commucation between the devs and the client is key.</br>

**W**<br/>
I have failed 2 courses in Q2, so that's my biggest motivation to pass this course as well as the other courses in Q3.</br>
My colleagues might be having the problem, so with that thought in mind I don't want them to fail to.</br>
According to the rubric, good communication may give you a positive grade already.</br>
So that's what I am going to focus on.
