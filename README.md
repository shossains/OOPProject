### Personal Development Plan

The most relevant strong    I have is that I am very driven to reach my goal.<br/>
If I try to achieve something with coding I will do everything it takes to make it work.<br/>
This of course can be troublesome because there might be a simpler solution to it.<br/>
I wouldn't call myself a perfectionist, not at all. I just want to achieve.<br/>

I have worked on (small) computer science projects in high school (mostly HTML, PHP and SQL).<br/>
In these projects I often took charge, because I was the most experienced in coding.<br/>
It is only after I started CSE that I realized that my knowledge of coding and computer science is just the bare minimum of what there is out there to learn.<br/>
Having worked in project before makes me experienced in group project.<br/>
I even have worked with Scrum before, which was quite a success.<br/>

My biggest pitfall might be that I tend to take too much *hooi op m'n vork*.<br/>
What might just look like simple challenges tend to turn out into the impossible quite often.<br/>
Only after (too) many tries I eventually give up and try to look for an alternative solution.<br/>

**G**<br/>
* Teamwork<br/>
Working in a team is something I have done quite often, but it never went smoothly.<br/>
Biggest bottleneck was communication.<br/>
Exchanging while after done editing, and sending uploaden duplicate files to server.<br/>
Now whe are using Git(lab) I hope problem won't occur.<br/>

* Dev-Client experience<br/>
I think this part is very useful for my possible future jobs and projects I will attend to.</br>
The interaction and communication between the client and the developer is a crucial part of the project which I would love to get more experience on.</br>

**R**<br/>
Well since we just started on this project, no progress has really occured.</br>
Thus no real statement can be made here.</br>

**O**<br/>
Working hard is the only option right here.</br>
Good commucation between the devs and the client is key.</br>

**W**<br/>
I have failed 2 courses in Q2, so that's my biggest motivation to pass this course as well as the other courses in Q3.</br>
My colleagues might be having the problem, so with that thought in mind I don't want them to fail to.</br>
According to the rubric, good communication may give you a positive grade already.</br>

Personal Development Plan
Develop a Goal
-	What are two of your strong points?
1.	A strong point of myself is that I can work well in a group. I can communicate well with others, even though I don’t know them. This I learned in my early years when I played football, I switched multiple times from clubs, which lead to meeting new team members over and over again. And the only way to play good together is playing as a team together.
2.	Another strong point of myself is that I am always willing to help others. Whenever someone has a question about something, or do need my help with something, I am always willing to do my best to help them. This is a good aspect in a team because whenever someone is stuck with something, and I do know how to solve it, I could help that person. 

-	What are two of your weaker points?
1.	A weaker point of myself is that I am a shy/quiet person. I don’t really speak up when I don’t need to. For example when I am with a group of people and they start to discuss whatever we would do, I won’t be the person who speaks up, and be the first person to say something or come up with something. This is could be a problem in a team, because everyone’s way of thinking is unique and if I don’t say what is on my mind then my team members also don’t know what my thoughts are about something. I don’t think I could make a core quadrant of this, because when I need to speak up, I will eventually do that.
2.	Another weaker point of myself is that I don't always express my opinion on things even though I personally believe it could have an added effect. This is mainly because I have an introvert personality. I could make a core quadrant of this, because sometimes my opinion could be the good one, and if I don’t tell it, it could lead to misunderstanding.

Create plan to achieve your goal
G - Goal
-	What is your learning goal during this course?
1.	My learning goal is to become a better programmer, not just programming itself, but programming in a team. This is important to me, because in the future I could come up with the same kind of project/task like this where we need to create something in a group of people who I don’t know. I hope I will achieve this goal when we are done with our project and created something where we are proud of.
2.	Another learning goal to try to express my opinions in the group whenever it is good or bad, because that would be the only way to learn from it. This is important to me because, this is something I have been struggling a while on, and it would be nice when I eventually will just express my opinions without being afraid whether it is good or bad. 

R - Reality (Your current situation)
-	Are you actively working on your goal?
1.	I am actively working on becoming a better programmer. I am trying to program as much as possible. The thing that is going well, is that I finally kind of understand Java and know how to use it. Things that could use improve are that I could improve my codes, I could write a code in a much simpler way or faster way.
2.	With expressing my opinions I just try to do that every day when I can. Sometimes it goes well, and I realize that my opinion can be helpful. There is still a lot of improvement possible, I could do it way more often, and I should not be afraid to make mistakes/give my opinion even though it is not good.

O - Options (Look at possible options)
-	What are options you have to achieve your goal?
1.	Options I have are just keep programming make mistakes and learn from them. Another option is to ask other people how they would program something. And the internet is always useful. 
2.	I don’t really have options to achieve this goal, because it is just something I face mostly every day, and the thing I need to do is just expressing my opinion.

-	Which option do you want to use the most?
1.	The option I want to use the most is to just keep programming and make mistakes and to eventually learn from those mistakes because that is how you become better at things by practicing it yourself.

-	What is stopping you reaching your goal?
1.	At the moment it is time what is stopping me to reach my goal, because there are also a lot of other courses which I need to learn at the moment and not just programming.

W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)
-	What are you going to do to reach your goal?
1.	I am going to try my best during this course to become a better programmer. Ask things when I don’t know something, look up thing on the internet. 
2.	I will express my opinions whenever I need to, even though it could be wrong, because that is when I learn the most out of it. 
-	What is the first concrete step you can take RIGHT NOW?
1.	The concrete step I can take right now, is to start right now. With both programming more and expressing my opinion more.
-	How can your teammates help you achieve this goal?
1.	By becoming a better programmer, my teammates can maybe help me by letting me know how they think about certain things when they are programming. Or when I have a question help me out.
2.	My teammates could help me achieve expressing my opinion more, by willing to listen to my opinion even though it is bad or good. So I can also know that I don’t have to be afraid to just express my opinion.
