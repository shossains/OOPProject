# Sprint Review

## Main problems Encountered

### Problem 1: testkey.jks FileNotFoundException
 - Description: On all except one of our systems, IntelliJ gives a FileNotFoundException for testkey.jks while the file is present in the directory and the tests concerning the file pass.
 - Reaction: We let the TA know, he said he'll look into it.

### Problem 2: Vegetarian Meal Button works only once
 - Description: When clicking the Vegeterian Meal button, information concerning the meal is passed to the table only once, after that the table remains unchanged.
 - Reaction: Vanessa will look further into it.
