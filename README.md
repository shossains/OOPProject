## Personal Development Plan

The most relevant strong I have is that I am very driven to reach my goal<br/>
If I try to achieve something with coding I will do everything it takes to make it work<br/>
This of course can be troublesome because there might be a simpler solution to it<br/>
I wouldn't call myself a perfectionist, not at all. I just want to achieve.<br/>

I have worked on (small) computer science projects in high school (mostly HTML, PHP and SQL)<br/>
In these projects I often took charge, because I was the most experienced in coding<br/>
It is only after I started CSE that I realized that my knowledge of coding and computer science is just the bare minimum of what there is out there to learn<br/>
Having worked in project before makes me experienced in group project<br/>
I even have worked with Scrum before, which was quite a success<br/>

My biggest pitfall might be that I tend to take too much **hooi op m'n vork**
What might just look like simple challenges tend to turn out into the impossible quite often
Only after (too) many tries I eventually give up and try to look for an alternative solution
