* Still issues with printing to the GUI
* The table in the GUI will show the added amount of points instead of the total amount added up to that point
* CO2 reduced needs to be logged in the table as well
* Lucas will start working on gamification
* Tasks need to be divided more clearly so people don't accidentally work on the same thing
