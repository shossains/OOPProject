# API List

*For all your API needs!*

## Basics
All requests are defined by a *type*, to denote what kind of request it is. Dont even think of sending one without it.

All APIs need authentication, give each request a *username* and *password*.
Armed with this knowledge, we can give our first example request, which sends a test request to our server:

{"type" : "TestRequest", "username" : "user", "password" : "hunter2", "isTest": true}
