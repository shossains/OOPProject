Personal Development Plan:
During this project, I'd like to improve my group-based communication skills. The communication aspect of group projects
has always been a weak point of mine, since I am very introverted and thus prefer to work on my own. 
For projects and jobs, however, a certain degree of concession is needed as a lack of communication will negatively impact the end product.
I think this project will be a good opportunity to work on this weak point of mine. I plan to achieving my goal by, obviously, doing
my part and by keeping my teammates up to date on what I'm doing and any potential difficulties I run into. I will also inquire about
what my teammates are working on, to get an idea of how the whole project is coming along. 

Another goal of mine is to learn how to use Git effectively. Coming into this project, this wasn't on my mind at all but after
using it for a bit it has become clear it's something I will have to invest time in. Git is a mandatory part of the project, so
hopefully my understanding of it will improve as the project goes on. 

Finally, I'd like to gain experience in working on developing a larger program. In the future most projects I'll be working on will 
most likely consist of many lines of code. This project will be a valuable learning experience in terms of learning how to plan
such an undertaking. Scrum especially will be helpful with organizing everything.
