<h1>Meeting Notes 04-03-2019</h1>

Chair: Lucas
<br>Notetaker: Shaan</br>

<h4>Last week</h4>
- Alex:
    - Redesigned server + added SSL/GSON
    - Server is not connected to anything yet but it works
- Lucas:
    - Worked on the logic for transportation
- Sami:
    - Did research on the API for the calculator
- Shaan:
    - Worked on input validation for the GUI
    - GUI switches scenes
- Vanessa:
    - Design VegMeal GUI
    - Since it is still barebones this will be improved

<h4>Questions</h4>
- [FIXED] Why does Maven:site not work?

<h4>Points of action</h4>
- Connect GUI with client/server instead directly to the DB
- Start on implementation for the API (priority: high)
    - This is probably the most difficult part of the project so it has a high priority
- Upload checkstyle report/Test coverage report


<h4>Demo/preview</h4>
- GUI is coming along pretty good. However it is directly connected to the DB,
it should be connected to the client/server class and then the database
