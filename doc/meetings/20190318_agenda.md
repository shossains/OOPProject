<h2>Question round</h2>

<h2>Points of action</h2>

> The items below are things you should look into after the meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.
> Your TA will you for the meeting. Note down all other questions that you have so that you can ask them then.

The next demo needs to be done only two weeks after this one, so we need to formulate a plan of action to reach the next deadline.

<h2>Any other business</h2>

> (Note:) Several documents/reports need to be finished at the end of every week

- Finish last week's sprint review
- Set up this week's sprint plan
- Upload a Checkstyle/JaCoCo screenshot
