## Approval of the agenda
> Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.

## Question round
> If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.

## Points of action
> The items below are things you should look into after the meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.

> Your TA will you for the meeting. Note down all other questions that you have so that you can ask them then.

 - Create a planning and convert it to GitLab issues
 - Discuss a cake rule: If you are late or not there at all, you have to bring cake (or something similar)

## Any other business
> If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.


## Closing
> Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!
